# What's This?

This is a simple bit of boilerplate to create a new testable Backbone application. It's setup for:

- Backbone
- Require.js
- Testem
- Package Management, via Jam

## Getting Started

- Git clone this rep
- Make sure you have [Jam](http://jamjs.org/) installed (`npm install -g jamjs`)
- Install Backbone and its dependencies: `jam install`
- Install [Testem](https://github.com/airportyh/testem) (`npm install testem -g`)
- Run the tests: `testem`

Have fun!
